# Exercises

Repository created to learn deeper about algorithms and data structures, it contains exercises from:

* CodeForces
* Cracking the coding interview
* HackerRank
* Skiena, the algorithm design manual


Note: This code is not created to run with arguments, if you are interested in testing them you can modify the script or adapt it to receive arguments.

Every method is separated in different files to keep track of where everything is located.
